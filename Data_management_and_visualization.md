### Data management and visualization

As the first step in the project, I download the data sets and examine the data. 

Firstly, I checked that there are no missing data in any variable in both sets. Secondly, I found it interesting to explore the frequency distribution of the wines' quality. For both wines, the majority of the samples have quality ranks `5`, `6`, and `7` (on the `0`-`10` scale). There are no samples ranked `0`, `1`, `2`, or `10`. However, the quality ranks of the white samples on average are higher the those of the reds.

There are the [code](https://github.com/ekolik/-Python-Ahalysis_of_wine_quality/blob/master/data_manag%26visualization.py) and its [output](https://github.com/ekolik/-Python-Ahalysis_of_wine_quality/blob/master/data_manag_output.txt) for this step in the project.
